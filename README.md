This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



## Structure of the project
In the `src` folder the `App.js` file contains the body of the app divided into several components.

Inside, the `state` is handled solely by the `ToDoApp` component which passes state and various methods to the child components in the form of `props`.

The `state` is saved in the `local Storage`.

The `css` style of the app is written in the `App.css` file.
